# About me

I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the IBM Technology Garage. I specialize Big Data, data understanding, and applying Agile practices to data projects. I live (and work from home) in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. When I'm not on the clock, I enjoy biking/swimming, fantasy books/shows/movies, and cuddling my cat Zara. 

In my previous career, I was an evolutionary biology researcher at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, New York, USA. I was awarded a Master's degree for my project about optimization algorithms for phylogenetics. Besides teaching me about algorithms, New York also taught me how to navigate the subway system and how to sing karaoke.

For college, I attended Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, USA, where I majored in Mathematical & Computational Biology with a concentration in Philosophy. The rigorous curriculum allowed me to take advanced classes in math, comptuer science, biology, and philosophy... while still also taking foundational classes in physics, chemistry, engineering, anthropology, French, creative writing, and more. I also worked as a STEM tutor for the Homework Hotline. Good times.

I was raised in San Luis Obispo, California, USA - "the happiest place in America". Despite living there happily for 18 years, I never planned to stay. Instead, I have spent my adult life testing the hypothesis that I can be equally happy in other places, by moving cities every ~4 years and traveling as much as I can.
