## Massive Science

I am currently working towards certification with the [Massive Science Consortium.]https://massivesci.com/  Massive Science aims to help scientists share both their research and their daily experiences with the public. Historically, science reporting focuses too much on the science itself, and not enough on who does it or how they did it. So, there are many misconceptions about who scientists are and what they do. 

Once I am a certified contributor, I hope to write articles distilling the ideas behind new computational methods across all the sciences. Such computational advances can affect everyone's lives. Plain language explanations are in high demand.

I already have some published lab notes and short comments. Keep up with my latest contributions [here!](https://massivesci.com/people/madison-hansen/)
